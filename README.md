# Node-Express-Authentication
Node App with Express for user Authentication. Use REST requests to get users, add a user or login (VSCode's REST Client is very handy to easily send REST requests with the editor using for example the res.rest file), . BCrypt is used to encrypt passwords.
No Database is used so users will not remain if the server is closed.
